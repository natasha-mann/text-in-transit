# üèÜ Challenge 3 - "Text In Transit" üî§

The challenge is to build a fixed-width, right-to-left text scroller capable of taking a string parameter and screen width as inputs. Seems simple, right?

### Rewards:

4Ô∏è‚É£ Points are awarded for a working text scroller demonstrated in either a console window or web app.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Further points are awarded for supporting sections of bold and underlined text (see examples)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Further points are awarded for supporting sections of coloured text (see examples)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Further point is awarded for supporting some kind of 'speed' input (e.g. characters per second)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Further point is awarded for supporting nested formatting (e.g. bold, underlined, coloured text (see example)).

### Examples:

```
scroll(text: "Welcome on board this service to [B]London[/B]. Please have [U]all[/U] tickets and passes ready for inspection. This service is expected to depart [C:#00FF00]on time[/C]", screenWidth: 10, speed: 2)
```

```
scroll(text: "[C:#FF0000]All of this text is Red, but [C:#0000FF][B][U]THIS[/U][/B] text is Blue.[/C][/C]", screenWidth: 8, speed: 4)
```

```
[  "          ",  "         G",  "        Go",  "       Goo",  "      Good",  "     Good ",  "    Good l",  "   Good lu",  "  Good luc",  " Good luck",  "ood luck ",  "od luck  ",  "d luck   ",  "luck     ",  "uck      ",  "ck       ",  "k        ",  "         ",]
